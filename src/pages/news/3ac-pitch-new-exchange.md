The co-founders of Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies are partnering with Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, co-founders of crypto exchange CoinFlex, to raise $25 million for a new exchange called GTX.  They said the plan is to create an exchange where users can trade crypto, stocks and debt claims on bankrupt companies like FTX.

CoinFLEX then clarified in a [blog post](https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflex-update-january-16-2023/) that the new raise is part of its own potential rebranding strategy and the current name, "GTX" is only serving as a placeholder for now. "Any new funds raised will be used for operational growth, which we strongly believe will increase value for CoinFLEX creditors." Both Lamb and Arumugam will remain as the new entities' executives, with Lamb continuing as the CEO, the blog post said.

Many in the crypto industry seem skeptical, with crypto market maker Wintermute's CEO Evgeny Gaevoy being one, stating in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/EvgenyGaevoy/status/1614984548886155271) "If you are investing into coinflex/3ac 'exchange' you might find it a bit more difficult to work with Wintermute in future (on the relationship building side)"

The presentation did not specify if users will also be able to trade 3AC claims. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Zhu, that some 3AC creditors would have the option to convert their claims into equity in the new claim-trading company.
