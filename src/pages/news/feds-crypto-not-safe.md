U.S. Banking regulators from the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC issued a warning to banks about cryptocurrencies. 
In a joint statement, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said banks should be aware of the “significant volatility and vulnerabilities over the past year” that the crypto industry experienced. Regulators added that banks with exposure to crypto could especially be at risk. 

Banking Regulators statement:

> “Based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or decentralized network or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices”.

Regulators and Politicians are sure to push hard for more transparency and rules around the cryptocurrency industry following the events of the past year, that included the collapse of the LUNA stablecoin and bankruptcies of several large crypto firms such as Celcius, BlockFi, Voyager and Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX. 
Billions in customer funds have been lost in the crypto crash including the alleged mismanagement of funds on FTX by Sam Bankman-Fried, in which he used customer funds to make risky investment through his trading firm he also founded, Alameda Research.
