The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed an objection to Binance.us proposed $1.02 billion purchase of the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager. In the filing, the SEC questioned the adequacy of the information in Binance.us disclosure statement, specifically details on the ability of the crypto exchange to “consummate a transaction of this magnitude,” as well as how Binance.us intends to secure customer assets.
The SEC said it has communicated its concerns to the exchanges counsel, and has been told that a revised disclosure statement will be filed prior to the next hearing.

Voyager plans to seek the approval of the bankruptcy court for the sales of its assets at a hearing on Jan. 5.
Voyager which went into bankruptcy earlier this year, had initially agreed to sell its assets to crypto exchange FTX, with FTX beating out Binance for the assets.
