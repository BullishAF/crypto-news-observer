According to a new report from Galaxy Digital, investments into crypto startups totaled less than $3 billion on fewer than 400 deals in the fourth quarter of last year, the lowest for both measures since the fourth quarter of 2020.
2022 began with a record number of deals and nearly $13 billion raised by startups. The first half of 2022 were driven by major players such as Andreessen Horowitz, Jump Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Haun Ventures.

U.S.-based crypto startups continued to dominate venture investments for the space, taking more than 40% of all deals in 2022.
Despite a year-on-year decline in overall venture capital deal sizes, valuations across the broader VC market rose slightly in Q4 while crypto prices dropped.
Crypto startups focused on trading took the bulk of venture dollars in the first half of 2022, while "web3" based companies focusing on NFTs, the metaverse and gaming made up the largest portion of funding by deal count in the second half of the year.
