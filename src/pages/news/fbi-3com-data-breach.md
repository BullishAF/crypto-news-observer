Coindesk has repeorted that two 3Commas users informed [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/29/fbi-investigating-3commas-data-breach/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines) that they were contacted by agents from the FBI’s Cincinnati Field Office about the 3Commas API Keys leak.

For several months now many users have found that 3Commas had traded away funds on crypto exchanges they’d linked their 3Comma account to, without their consent. 3Commas claimed these users were most likely phished and insisted that the platform was safe. The API leaker insinuated that the 3Commas keys had been sold by someone inside the company, but 3Commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin released this statement refuting that claim on Thursday 

> “3Commas stresses that it has found no evidence during the internal investigation that any employee of 3Commas was somehow involved in attacks against the API data. Since becoming aware of the suspicious activities taking place, we immediately launched an internal investigation. We will continue with the investigation in the light of the new information and also notify law enforcement authorities accordingly.” - 3commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin

A 3Commas victim group, previously reached out to the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies to understand how their funds had gone missing.
