After the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, depositors began pulling money out of Silvergate Bank. The California bank shored up its liquidity by tapping an agency not typically known as a lender of last resort. 
According to company filings, Silvergate received $4.3 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco late last year.

The crypto-friendly bank now holds roughly $4.6 billion in cash â€” most of which came from the Home Loan Bank advances, according to [financial metrics](https://ir.silvergate.com/news/news-details/2023/Silvergate-Announces-Select-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2022-Financial-Metrics-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx) the bank released last week. 
The liquidity injection Silvergate received from the Home Loan Bank System shows one way in which regulators and politicians are concerned about the crypto industry managing to find its way into the mainstream banking system.

"Home Loan Banks" like the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco have also been under fire recently as critics question whether these type of banks are engaged in the primary mission of supporting housing.
