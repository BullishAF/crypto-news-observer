Former FTX engineering chief Nishad Singh met with federal prosecutors, becoming the third member of Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle at FTX or Alameda Research to cooperate in return for a deal in the fraud case over the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse.

Singh, who has **not** been accused of any wrongdoing, attended a proffer session last week at the Southern District of New York US Attorney’s Office, according to people familiar with the matter. Individuals are usually granted a limited immunity to share what they know with prosecutors in these type of meetings.

Caroline Ellison the former CEO of crypto trading firm Alameda Research and Gary Wang who co-founded FTX with Sam Bankman-Fried had already agreed to deals with federal prosecutors in return for lighter sentences.
