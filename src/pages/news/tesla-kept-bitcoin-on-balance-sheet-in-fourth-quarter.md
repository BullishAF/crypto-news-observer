Tesla did not sell any of its Bitcoin despite the overall market decline following the collapse of FTX and other crypto firms late last year, according to it's Q4 results announcement on January 25th.

The company had $184 million in "digital assets" as of December 31 as opposed to $218 million the previous quarter. This decline is due to $34 million in impairment charges brought on by the price decline of Bitcoin between the end of September and December of last year.

Tesla sold 75% of it's Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter of last year with CEO Elon Musk saying at the time that the sale was intended to “prove Bitcoin’s liquidity as an alternative to holding cash on a balance sheet.”
