Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) reportedly ordered Gary Wang, co-founder of the crypto exchange, to open a $65 billion "secret backdoor line of credit" for Alameda Research, according to FTX attorney Andrew Dietderich.
The backdoor was a secret way for Alameda to borrow from customers on the exchange without permission.

FTX attorney Andrew Dietderich:
> Mr. Wang created this backdoor by inserting a single number into millions of lines of code for the exchange, creating a line of credit from FTX to Alameda, to which customers did not consent.

Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang have already pleaded guilty to charges related to the case. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges. 

SBF has denied allegations of stealing FTX funds. He said in a substack post that "as Alameda became illiquid, FTX International did as well, because Alameda had a margin position open on FTX; and the run on the bank turned that illiquidity into insolvency.‚Äù
