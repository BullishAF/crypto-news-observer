Crypto exchange Binance is temporarily suspending USD bank transfers starting on Wednesday. U.S. Banks have been limiting their exposure to the crypto industry after the collaspe of crypto exchange FTX and warnings from federal regulators.

Just 0.01% of monthly active users use USD bank transfers and other methods of buying and selling crypto remain unaffected, including bank transfer using one of the other fiat currencies, buying and selling crypto via credit card, debit card, Google Pay and Apple Pay.
