Sam Bankman-Fried released a [new post Thursday morning on Substack](https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview) to give his take on what led to the collapse of FTX.

He denied stealing funds and said the reason the crypto fund he founded, Alameda Research collapsed was the overall financial market meltdown which included crypto and the stock market. He also said Alameda wasn't hedged enough.

SBF:

 > “I didn’t steal funds, and I certainly didn’t stash billions away. Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for”

He said he is willing to use nearly all his personal assets including the Robinhood shares, to help customers who lost money. He touched on several topics in the post including the handling of the bankruptcy by John J. Ray, his belief that CZ launched a coordinated attack on FTX and his "rumored" drug use.

Bankman-Fried faces federal fraud charges and he has pleaded not guilty.
