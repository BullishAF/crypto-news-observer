After several days of speculation, Huobi has announced it will be laying off about 20% of it's staff. Internal emails that were obtained by [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/199687/huobi-cut-staff-20) stated that Huobi had moved to enforce salary payments in stablecoins instead of fiat currency, sparking protests from staff.
The email further indicated that year-end bonuses would be canceled along with various other benefits, however a Huobi’s spokesperson said it is incorrect and that bonuses and benefits have not been cut. 

On October 7th 2022 Huobi was acquired by About Capital Management and days later, Tron founder Justin Sun was named an advisor to Huobi. Some speculate that he was actually the one behind the About Capital deal, although Justin Sun has repeatedly denied those claims. 
Several employees are claiming Huobi has closed down internal communication and feedback channels. A Huobi’s spokesperson denied this and made this statement in response “Huobi will fully respect the legitimate demands of local employees, and continue to provide industry-competitive incentives and treatment for outstanding talent.”
