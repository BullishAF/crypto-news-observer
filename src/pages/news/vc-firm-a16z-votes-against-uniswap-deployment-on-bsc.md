Crypto venture capital firm a16z has used its 15 million UNI governance tokens to vote against a proposal that would use the wormhole bridge for Uniswap V3 deployment on Binance Smart Chain. The VC firm's 15 Million tokens allowed it to sway the proposal in it's favor.

The proposal to deploy the latest Uniswap iteration on the BSC(Binance Smart Chain) was submitted on Feb. 2 and a temperature check showed 80% in favor of the proposal. For a proposal to pass it must achieve a quorum of 4% or 40 million UNI tokens.

The decision to vote against the proposal was due to the choice of cross-chain bridge to be used in the proposal. 0xPlasma Labs preferred wormhole, while a16z is in favor of using LayerZero. a16z led the $135 million investment round of the LayerZero protocol in March 2022.
