Surojit Chatterjee the "Chief Product Officer" of Coinbase is officially leaving the company on February 3rd. Coinbase and Chatterjee have a separation agreement that includes severance benefits and an advisory deal in which he will provide advisory services from Feb 4 to Dec 31 of this year.

Chatterjee has reportedly made $105 million in stock sales, he will also retain 249,315 shares of Coinbase stock according to [disclosures](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978822000134/coin-20221028.htm) filed with the SEC.

He will receive “a lump sum payment consistent with our existing Change of Control and Severance Policy, which provides for payments and benefits to executive officers upon certain qualifying terminations.” 

Chatterjee left Google to join Coinbase in February 2020 receiving a $646 Million compensation package and salary of nearly $1 million per year. He oversaw the creation of the Coinbase NFT Marketplace which has been viewed as a disappointment by many in the crypto industry.
