US crypto exchange Coinbase has announced it's cutting 20% of its employees in a second wave of layoffs.
CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase will cut 950 jobs as part of the company’s measures to reduce the firm’s operating costs by around 25%.

Armstrong also said Coinbase will be shutting down several projects with a “lower probability of success".
The Company expects execution of the plan to be complete by the second quarter of 2023.

The latest layoffs come months after Coinbase initially reduced its headcount by 18% in June 2022, with Armstrong citing a starting economic recession.
