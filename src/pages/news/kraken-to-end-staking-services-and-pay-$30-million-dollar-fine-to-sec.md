The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd., commonly known as Kraken, for failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. The program allowed investors to transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual investment returns.

According to the SEC's complaint, Kraken has been offering its staking services since 2019, pooling certain crypto assets transferred by investors and staking them on behalf of the investors. Staking involves locking up crypto tokens with a blockchain validator in exchange for a reward in new tokens.

Kraken has agreed to immediately cease offering staking services and pay $30 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler:
> Todayâ€™s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.
