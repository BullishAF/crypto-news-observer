DeFi analyst "BowTiedIguana" posted a [series of tweets](https://twitter.com/BowTiedIguana/status/1608653434387050496) on Thursday night pointing to blockchain data that they think is showing that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX who was just released on bail a week ago, may have recently moved over $684,000 worth of crypto. 
In August of 2020 Sam Bankman-Fried agreed to take over control of the DeFi exchange Sushiswap from anonymous founder Chef Nomi and asked for control of the exchange to be sent to his wallet address.

According to "BowTiedIguana" the ETH from SBF's public wallet was sent to a newly created address and within hours, that new address also received transfers totaling $367k from 32 wallets identified as SBF's former crypto trading firm Alameda Research Ltd. + $322k from various other wallets.  
All of it was then sent to a Crypto Excange in Seychelles or to the Ren BTC bridge which also happened to be funded and operated by Alameda Research. 

Also coming into question in this situation is one of SBF's bail conditions set by the Judge, which stated he could not open any new credit lines of more than $1,000 USD. 
Although so far these are just accusations, if it was able to be proved that he moved the crypto, it's not known whether that would be in violation of his bail agreement. One issue is that someone "moving" crypto to other addresses doesn't necessarily equate to "spending" it and also if the assets were already in his possesion, would creating a new wallet be looked at the same as him opening an new account.
