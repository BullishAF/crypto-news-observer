Silvergate is cutting 40% of its total staff or about 200 employees, the firm said on Thursday. Shares of Silvergate tanked 41% at $12.89 following the announcement.
The bank also halted its plans to launch a digital currency and announced it will write off $196 million related to Diem that it acquired from Meta. 
Diem announced in February of last year that Silvergate would be buying its assets and technology.

Silvergate CEO Alan Lane:
> In response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows, and we currently maintain a cash position in excess of our digital asset related deposits.

Silvergate's Exchange Network(SEN) Platform had an average daily trade volume of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from $1.2 billion in the previous quarter.
However it also witnessed an outflow of around $8.1 billion in digital asset deposits during the fourth quarter. To counter the outflows, Silvergate announced it sold off $5.2 billion of debt securities, incurring a loss of $718 million.
