Cameron Winklevoss the co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, posted an "Open Letter" on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608) addressed to Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group(DCG). 
In the letter Winklevoss says that Barry Silbert is engaged in "bad faith stall tactics" and that Silbert is not taking responsibility for Genesis Trading, a DCG subsidiary, owing over $900 million to users of the "Gemini Earn" program that was offered on the Winklevoss Brothers crypto exchange Gemini.

In a reply to that post, Barry Silbert stated "DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023. DCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 29th and has not received any response".

Cameron Winklevoss also tells Silbert to "Stop trying to pretend that you and DCG are innocent bystanders and had nothing to do with creating this mess. It's completely disingenuous. 

Digital Currency Group, which in addition to Gensis Trading, also includes Grayscale Investments that operates the "Grayscale Bitcoin Trust", was reportedly seeking a $1 billion loan in early November according to the Wall Street Journal.
Leading to speculation that Genesis Trading may be the next crypto company in a long list that have had to file for bankruptcy since the LUNA collaspe.
