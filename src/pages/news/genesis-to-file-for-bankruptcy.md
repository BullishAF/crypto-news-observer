Genesis is currently negotiating a Chapter 11 filing, according to sources.
Gemini and other creditors would agree to a forbearance period of between one and two years. Creditors will receive cash payments and equity in Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group.

Genesis halted withdrawals on its platform last year and owe Gemini "Earn" users more than $900 Million. 
Creditors have been privately negotiating with Genesis in an effort to finalize a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection plan ahead of the filing.

Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has publicly criticized DCG CEO Barry Silbert and demanded he be removed as CEO, accusing him of comingling funds and negotiating in bad faith.
