The Federal government is now in the process of seizing a number of assets linked to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, that includes up to $450 Million of shares in trading app Robinhood.
The assets could later be subject to forfeiture proceedings, as the cases against FTXâ€™s Founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and senior executives Gary Wang and Carolyn Ellison continue.

FTX asked a federal court to weigh in on the ownership the $450 million in Robinhood shares. The owner of those shares is disputed between bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi, Sam Bankman-Fried, and FTX creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon.

Assets have been seized or were in the process of being seized from a number of banks, including Silvergate, a bank closely tied to FTX, and could be subject to civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings.
