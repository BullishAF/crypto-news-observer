The U.S. Federal government has seized or is in the process of seizing a number of assets potentially linked to bankrupt crypto company FTX, including $450 Million of shares in trading app Robinhood.
The assets could later be subject to forfeiture proceedings, as Department of Justice cases against FTX’s Founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and senior executives Gary Wang and Carolyn Ellison continue.

FTX, which filed for bankruptcy Nov. 11, has asked a federal court to weigh in on the ownership of about $450 million worth of Robinhood shares. The owner of those shares is disputed between bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi, Bankman-Fried, and FTX creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon.
One of the motions put forward was “related to Robinhood shares, which the federal government has also seized,” Department of Justice counsel Seth Shapiro said.

Shapiro said assets had been seized or were in the process of being seized from a number of banks, including Silvergate, a bank closely tied to FTX, and could be subject to civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings.
