An agreement between Binance.US and bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital may be subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States

The review could also cause the agreement between the two crypto firms to get nixed. The Bankruptcy court will take consider the Foreign Investment Committee review and potential national security concerns, when determining a bidderâ€™s qualification.

Binance.us, the US subsidiary of the biggest crypto exchange in the world Binance, offered to make an initial $10 million deposit and pay Voyager an additional maximum of $15 million for expenses. 

The agreement would have allowed customers to gain access to locked funds and receive disbursements from Voyager on Binance.us.
