Judge Lewis Kaplan who handled lawsuits against Prince Andrew and Donald Trump will now oversee the trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. He replaces his colleague Ronnie Abrams, after Abrams recused herself due to a potential conflict of interest. 

Judge Kaplan is no stranger to high-profile cases, as he is currently overseeing a lawsuit brought forward by ex-journalist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Donald Trump of defamation when he denied that he raped her in the 1990s. 

He also presided over a civil lawsuit against actor Kevin Spacey for an alleged “unwanted sexual advance” and also a case against Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, for sexual assault.

It is alleged Bankman-Fried committed fraud by using investors’ funds from the FTX crypto exchange to make risky bets via trading firm Alameda Research, which he also founded. He is facing eight criminal charges—including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit at the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office is handling the case.
