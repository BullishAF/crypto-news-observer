Fidelity's focus appears to be the metaverse, with the firm suggesting that it could offer a wide range of investment services within virtual worlds including mutual funds, retirement funds, investment management and financial planning.

A metaverse-based payment services could be in the works, including bill payments, fund transfers and the “financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.” 

Fidelity also stated that it could offer educational services in the metaverse in the form of “conducting classes, workshops, seminars and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services.

NFTs are also a part of Fidelity's future plans, with a manager stating that "it could launch an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of digital media, namely, non-fungible tokens."

Fidelity was reportedly looking to expand its crypto unit by hiring 100 new staff members back in October. Most crypto and tech companies this year have put hiring freezes in place and laid off large amounts of employees.
