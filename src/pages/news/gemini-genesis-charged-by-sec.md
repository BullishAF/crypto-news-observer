Genesis Global Capital LLC and Gemini Trust Company LLC have been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the unregistered offer and sale of securities through the Gemini "Earn" program. 
It has also resulted in a public spat between Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss and Genesis parent comapny DCG CEO Barry Silbert in recent weeks. 

Regulators said Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, entered into an agreement in December 2020 with Gemini crypto exchange to allow Gemini customers to loan their crypto to Genesis thru the Gemini "Earn" program.
The SEC says Gemini acted as the agent to facilitate the transactions. Gemini also deducted an "agent fee" as high as 4.29% from the returns Genesis paid to Gemini "Earn" investors. 


SEC Chair Gary Gensler:
 > Today’s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. 
 > Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It’s not optional. It’s the law.

Genesis, who was holding about $900 million in investor assets, announced in November of 2022 that it would not allow Gemini Earn investors to withdraw their crypto because it could not meet withdrawal requests. 
Gemini ended the program with Genesis earlier this month. Retail investors in Gemini Earn have yet to be able to withdraw their assets.
