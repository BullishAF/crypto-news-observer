Logan Paul, the podcaster, boxer and actor is one of the defendants in a class action lawsuit filed against the NFT project CryptoZoo.

The class action lawsuit filed on behalf of 20,000 victims, alleges that the project was a so-called "rug pull" and the price of CryptoZoo’s native token ZOO was manipulated. Other defendants include Danielle Strobel, Jeffrey Levin and Jake Greenbaum.

CryptoZoo was launched in 2021 as an NFT gaming project, with Paul as one of its founders. The project was promoted using Paul’s online platforms as a means of passive income. Investors committed over $2 million to CryptoZoo before the project launched and the ZOO token skyrocketed in value.

CryptoZoo social media accounts have been inactive and Logan Paul has apologized and promised to fix things.
The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of any profit gained from the project.
