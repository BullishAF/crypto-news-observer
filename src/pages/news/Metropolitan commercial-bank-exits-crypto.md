Metropolitan Commercial Bank announced today it will no longer take part in business involving crypto assets, highlighting the changing regulatory climate for banks participating in crypto.
The decision comes a week after three US financial authorities called crypto "unsafe" and advised Banks against doing business involving crypto assets, citing the volatile cryptocurrency market and high-profile failures of many large crypto businesses.
MCBâ€™s interactions with crypto customers are limited to debit cards, payment, and account services. The Company has no outstanding loans to any of those clients, no crypto-assets on its balance sheet, and no crypto-assets to market or sell to its customers. 
The Bank has started the process of winding down it's crypto services and hopes to finish by 2023.
