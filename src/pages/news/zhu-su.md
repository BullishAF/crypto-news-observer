Zhu Su the co-founder of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital alleged in a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1610093549651136512?s=20&t=k-q-GNrOwqlZprwhVedI4A) that Digital Currency Group (DCG) and FTX conspired to attack Terra LUNA and staked Ethereum (stETH).
He says the founder of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried and DCG CEO Barry Silbert launched an attacked due to their close relationship and noted that SBF was on the board of DCG subsidiary, Genesis Trading, which issued Sam Bankman-Fried the first loan backed by FTX exchange token FTT as collateral.

Zhu Su's Three Arrows Capital was a large stakeholder in its Grayscaleâ€™s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as well as LUNA and suffered substantial losses on both which eventually led to the fund filing for bankruptcy. Zhu Su says DCG employed misdirection tactics that allowed it to keep operating while insolvent and hoping the market would recover and that DCG value is $0.
DCG owes Genesis $1.675 Billion that consist of a $575 million liability due in May 2023, and a $1.1 billion promissory note Genesis issued to Zhu Su's Three Arrows Capital, which Digital Currency Group absorbed following the crypto hedge fund's collapse. Meanwhile Genesis which is a DCG subsidiary owes "Gemini Earn" users $900 Million as referenced by Gemini Exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss in an "open letter" he posted to twitter yesterday.

Many people in the crypto industry say that the "loans" CEO Barry Silbert claims Genesis issued to DCG, are similiar to the co-mingling that happened between FTX and Alameda Research who were both founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.
