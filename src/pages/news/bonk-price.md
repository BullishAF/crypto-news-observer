$BONK the meme-coin on Solana is now sitting at a price of $0.00000121 up over 1300% since the all-time low of $0.000000086142 just four days ago. It initially fell over 40% overnight before rising and hitting another all-time high again under an hour ago.

Many NFT and DeFi projects on Solana have started integrating BONK in addition to several exchanges announcing it's listing BONK such as [Huobi](https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1610227879530622977) and it's popularity continues to soar on "crypto twitter". 

It has sparked an excitement and new interest in the Solana Blockchain which has also contributed to SOL being up more than 8% in the last 24 hours.
