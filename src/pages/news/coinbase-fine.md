A report from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/business/coinbase-settlement-anti-money-laundering.html) says Coinbase announced it has reached an agreement with New York Financial Regulators to pay $50 million to resolve a New York investigation into lax rules around its anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance programs.
The crypto exchange also says it will invest an additional $50 million to improve those programs. Coinbase which is headquartered in the United States and regulated by state financial statutes had a backlog of more than 100,000 unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts and 14,000 customers requiring enhanced due diligence procedures, according to New York regulators. 

The company’s procedures for backgrounds of customers were so inadequate that early last year, regulators ordered Coinbase to hire an outside monitor to oversee its compliance, even as the formal investigation was underway.

Adrienne A. Harris NY superintendent of financial services:
> We found failures that really warranted putting in place an independent monitor rather than wait for a settlement.
>
> We have been very outspoken about illicit financing concerns in the space. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal:
> Coinbase remains committed to being a leader and role model in the crypto space, and this means partnering with regulators when it comes to compliance and other areas.

In August, the Department of Financial Services fined the crypto trading arm of the financial brokerage Robinhood $30 million for violating financial regulations, including anti-money-laundering laws and in November, the Treasury Department announced a settlement U.S.-based exchange, Kraken, over trading services it provided to customers in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions.
Authorities are also investigating potential anti-money-laundering violations by Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading exchange.
