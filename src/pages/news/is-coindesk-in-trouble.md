Yesterday The New York Times reported that CoinDesk, the company that broke the news that led to FTX filing for bankruptcy, may also be facing trouble relating to the federal probe of it's parent company Digital Currency Group(DCG).

CoinDesk has covered DCG, the federal investigation, and the issues at Genesis. It has also remained persistent in covering disagreements between Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of Gemini, and Barry Silbert, CEO of DCG. Michael Casey, CoinDesk’s chief content officer, said in a statement to The New York Times that it has covered DCG similarly to all other companies in the crypto space.

Amanda Cowie, the head of communications at Digital Currency Group, declined to comment on the probe. She, however, stated that their firm was not involved in CoinDesk’s editorial decisions. 

Coindesk was first to publish a scoop on FTX, suggesting that Sam Bankman-Fried's other company, crypto fund Alameda Research, could be in financial trouble. Both FTX and Alameda Research filed for bankruptcy a week later and Bankman-Fried is now facing federal fraud charges.
