Sources claim Digital Currency Group(DCG) and Genesis Trading knew that FTX and Alameda Research were insolvent as early as May 2022, and DCG founder Barry Silbert and his companies had actively put pressure on Alameda, demanding the repayment of a $2.5 billion loan owed to Genesis.

The Department of Justice and US Securities and Exchange Commission also recently announced investigations into money transfers between DCG and the group’s subsidiary Genesis Trading. A report says they have requested interviews and documents from DCG and Genesis. 

The report, citing people familiar with the matter, also said that both companies were “allegedly engaged in misconduct.” DCG currently owes Genesis over $1.1 billion, while Genesis also owes the Gemini Crypto exchange "earn" program users over $900 million.
