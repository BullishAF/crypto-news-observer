Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to plead not guilty next week to the charges against him according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.
Bankman-Fried is expected to show up in person in New York on January 3 to enter his plea.

SBF’s associate, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda research, FTX’s sister company, and Gary Wang, the former CTO of FTX have entered into plea deals with prosecutors. The not guilty plea from SBF was widely expected as before his arrest he claimed that faulty records and bank accounts were to blame for the illegal transfer of funds to Alameda Research.

After making an appearance in a New York federal court following his extradition from the Bahamas, SBF was released on a 250 million USD bond and given permission to remain in his parents’ Palo Alto, California residence.

Prosecutors argue that SBF made illegal transactions all the way back to the year 2019, along with other associates, and has been lying to investors and customers about Alameda’s financial situation. He has also made huge donations to the both political parties in the U.S.

Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also made accusations against SBF. In total, SBF is facing 8 different charges and if proven guilty could face up to 100 years in prison.
