Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty in New York federal court to eight charges related to the collapse of his former crypto exchange FTX
and crypto fund Alameda Research.

He was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.
Judge Lewis Kaplan set Oct. 2 as the start date for Bankman-Fried’s trial.

Bankman-Fried arrived to a media frenzy outside the courthouse as camera's and reporters quickly swarmed him. Attorneys for Bankman-Fried filed a motion earlier in the day to seal the names of two individuals who had signed for him on his bond. 
They said the visibility of the case has already posed a risk to Bankman-Fried’s parents, and that the individuals who signed for his bail should not be subject to the same scrutiny and Judge Kaplan approved the motion.

Federal prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the court that Bankman-Fried had worked with foreign regulators to transfer assets that FTX’s U.S. management had been attempting to recover through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and asked Judge Kaplan to impose a new restriction barring Bankman-Fried from transferring or accessing FTX customer assets with the judge approving that motion as well.
FTX’s attorneys claim that Bahamian regulators have illicitly transferred hundreds of millions of dollars, and that Bankman-Fried assisted them. Bahamian regulators say that local laws give them jurisdiction over those assets, and dispute the validity of the U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings.
