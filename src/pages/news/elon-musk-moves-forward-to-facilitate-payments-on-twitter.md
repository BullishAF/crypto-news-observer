Twitter has started applying for regulatory licences and mapping out the architecture needed to facilitate payments.

Allowing payments through Twitter is a part of Musk’s plan to open up fresh revenue streams. Twitter’s $5 billion per year ad business has took a hit with marketers citing concerns over its management and content moderation.

Musk has said he wants Twitter to offer services such as peer-to-peer transactions and debit cards. Musk previously co-founded X.com, which later became part of payments giant PayPal.

Twitter registered with the US Treasury as a payments processor in November of last year, according to a regulatory filing.  While the payments feature will initially be in fiat, Musk also wants the ability to allow payments in crypto sometime in the future.
