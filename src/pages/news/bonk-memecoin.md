Dogecoin - Elon Musk's favorite "memecoin" and Shiba Inu - the darkhorse memecoin that had a meteoric rise during the crypto bull run and is now a top 20 token remain the gold standards for dog-themed "memecoins" in crypto. Now [BONK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk) a self-proclaimed "first Solana dog coin for the people and by the people", is becoming the latest dog-themed "memecoin" to surge in popularity. 

Thanks to air-dropping 50% of the supply on Christmas and a well run [twitter account](https://twitter.com/bonk_inu) it continues to gain popularity among the "crypto twitter" crowd. Solana and SOL the native Solana Blockchain token have been hit harder than most crypto ecosystems lately and SOL is down over 16% in the past 30 days. 

SOL's crash has been in part due to Sam Bankman-Fried's former crypto fund Alameda Research involvement with the token and ecosystem before the FTX collaspe as well as the NFT projects DeGods and Y00Ts announcing they were migrating to the Polygon Blockchain.
BONK is one of the few bright spots for Solana lately and the memecoin is now up more than 300% after hitting an all-time low of $0.000000086142 on Dec. 29th.
