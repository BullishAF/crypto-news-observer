According to a report from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2022/12/24/these-crypto-founders-and-bitcoin-moguls-lost-116-billion-in-2022/?sh=57e9848442b2) Crypto Billionaires have had $116 Billion in wealth wiped out since March. Sam Bankman-Fried the founder and former CEO of FTX who was indicted last week by prosecutors on fraud and money laundering charges, had his entire net-worth, an *estimated* $24 Billion go to $0 in a just matter of days. His co-founder and former FTX CTO Gary Wang had his net-worth also wiped completely to $0 from a once estimated $5.9 Billion.

If you thought going from $24 Billion to $0 would hurt, Chanpeng Zhao(CZ) the founder and CEO of the worlds largest crypto exchange Binance, who basically kicked off the FTX drama and ended SBF along with his crypto empire, is reported to have lost a absolutely mind-numbing **$60 BILLION** since the crypto chaos started. His net-worth in March was estimated to be $65 Billion and is now down to *just* $4.5 Billion. 

Brian Armstrong the Founder and CEO of the regulated, public US crypto exchange Coinbase went from $6 Billion in March to barely holding on to his "Billionaire status" at $1.5 Billion. Armstrong was able to cash-in on his large Coinbase stake when it went public in April of 2021, selling nearly 750,000 shares for an estimated $291 Million at the time. He also recently [purchased a mansion in Bel Air](https://sports.yahoo.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-bought-111713833.html) in January of this year for $133 Million. 

Another notable name on the list is Barry Silbert, his crypto firm Digital Currency Group(DCG) could potentially be insolvent as reports have surfaced that DCG is $2 Billion in debt and struggling to raise capital. 
As such, Forbes says it considers his 40% stake in Digital Currency Group to be worth $0.
