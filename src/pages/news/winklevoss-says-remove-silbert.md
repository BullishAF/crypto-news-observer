Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss demanded the removal of Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert in another open letter,  in response to the frozen funds of the exchange's Earn users.

He says that DCG subsidiary Genesis Trading had mislead the company, Earn users and the public about the company's solvency and financial health. 

Winklevoss had accused Silbert of stalling efforts to reclaim funds for Gemini Earn users, accusing the head of "bad faith stall tactics" and comingling funds in an open letter last week.

He called on the DCG board to remove Silbert as CEO, saying there is "no path forward" with him in control of the company.
