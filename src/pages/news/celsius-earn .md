A federal judge ruled that customers of Celsius's interest-bearing "Earn" product had turned over control of their assets to the bankrupt crypto lender and they are part of the company's bankruptcy estate.
Judge Martin Glenn said in a court order Wednesday that Celsius's terms of service made it clear it took possession of crypto assets deposited into its Earn product. Celsius held around $4.2 billion in various cryptocurrencies in its Earn product as of July 2022.
Celsius argued that the cryptocurrency deposited in Earn Accounts were owned by the them under the "Terms of Use" however the Celsius Earn account holders had argued that rather than Celsius, they own the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts and that cryptocurrency assets should be promptly returned to them.
Some account holders had also argued that Celsius was in breach of its own contract or that Celsius had "failed to uphold its fiduciary duties," but the judge called Celsius's terms of service "unambiguous."

Judge Martin Glenn wrote of the ruling:
> The Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use, and subject to any reserved defenses, that when the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins, discussed in detail below) were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates. 
> The issue of ownership of the assets in the Earn Accounts is a contract law issue. The Debtors and Committee argue that the cryptocurrency assets deposited in Earn Accounts were owned by the Debtors and are now property of the Estates. Many Earn account holders argue that the Account Holders, rather than Celsius, own the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts and that cryptocurrency assets should promptly be returned to them," Glenn wrote.

The ruling allows Celsius to retain control over the assets in its Earn account and will now have ramifications for cryptocurrency investors using similar products across other platforms, a number of which have also entered bankruptcy in recent months.
The court will hold a hearing on Jan. 10, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss a motion on when Celsius creditors can submit their claims by. A filing from Kirkland & Ellis attorney Joshua Sussberg currently proposes Feb. 9, 2023, as the deadline for proofs of claim, extending certain existing deadlines if approved.
