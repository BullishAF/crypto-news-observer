FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has filed a court action to block debtors from taking control of a roughly $450 million stake in brokerage Robinhood.
SBF lawyers argue the shares do not belong to any FTX-related entities in the bankruptcy proceedings, and that Bankman-Fried needs the money to fund legal expenses.

FTX entities including former crypto trading firm Alameda Research are now in bankruptcy and under the control of court-appointed liquidators seeking access to any assets they can obtain, which includes the Robinhood shares,in order to help repay roughly 1 million creditors of FTX.
Bankrupt crypto lending firm BlockFi as well as an FTX creditor, and the U.S. Department of Justice have all sought control of the Robinhood shares so far. 

Bankman-Fried and fellow FTX co-founder Gary Wang bought the 56.2 million shares in Robinhood via special purpose vehicle "Emergent Fidelity Technology". 
The two allegedly borrowed money via promissory notes, in order to then purchase the Robinhood shares from Alameda Research.
