Could the US government be quietly coordinating a crackdown against the crypto industry by pressuring banks to avoid offering banking services to crypto businesses? U.S. Banking regulators from the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC have already publicly issued a warning to banks about cryptocurrencies, calling them "not safe". 

Obtaining access to the US banking system has always been challenging for crypto companies and now with the recent crypto contagion that resulted in several large crypto firms filing for bankruptcy, the industry is now facing more challenges with the banking system.

Crypto Bank Silvergate has faced major scrunity and is under investigation by the DOJ due to providing services to FTX and Alameda research. 
Metropolitan Commercial Bank has announced it will shutdown all of its cryptoasset-related services and The Federal Reserve denied crypto bank Custodia’s application to become a member of the Federal Reserve system, citing “safety and soundness” risks.

The largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, recently announced that due to a new policy at Signature bank they can now only process fiat transactions worth more than $100,000 and also suspended USD bank transfers for it's retail clients. Crypto exchanges and other crypto businesses that rely on fiat onramps are now concerned that the few remaining bank partners will shut them off. 

This wouldn't be the first "choke point" operation by the US Government and Banks. Back in 2013 the US Government began applying pressure on the banking sector with threats issued to any banks that supported poker companies, payday lenders and other industries it had deemed "not safe".
