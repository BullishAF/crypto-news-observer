Prosecutors have shared copies of Sam Bankman-Fried’s messages to FTX CEO John Ray III and an unnamed witness in court documents on Monday. Prosecutors are seeking to restrict his communication with former employees.

SBF contacted an unnamed witness in the case asking to establish a “constructive relationship”. He also reached out to FTX CEO John Ray III in an email on January 2, the day before he pleaded not guilty to charges against him. 

The Justice Department suggests he tried to influence witnesses in the case and wants to amend the conditions of his bail to restrict access to encrypted messaging services and ban him from communicating with former employees of FTX and Alameda Research.

Bankman-Fried’s lawyers meanwhile claims prosecutors made an effort to “portray our client in the worst possible light" during the process of amending his bail.
