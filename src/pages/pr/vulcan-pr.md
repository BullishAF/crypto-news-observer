The protocol, which has been under development for some time aims to balance supply-side issues affecting market stability. In this vein, the primary key feature of the Vulcan Blockchain is its Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes. 

Vulcan, named after the god of fire and forge, features unique never before seen blockchain technology. Auto-Rebasing is a unique feature that allows a blockchain to automatically adjust its supply of circulating coins.

**Jason Matthison, COO of Vulcan said in a statement:**

> *By clearly outlining the rules and conditions under which the supply of tokens will be adjusted, an auto-rebasing blockchain can give users and investors a better understanding of the monetary policy of the network. This can help to increase confidence in the network, making it more attractive to users and investors*.

To add to its Auto-Rebasing, Auto-Compounding capabilities, the Vulcan Blockchain also has a unique burn mechanism, known as the “Fire Pit” (a null address).

80% of all transaction fees on the network are automatically sent to the Fire Pit, which is totally inaccessible and burns the coins from the circulating supply forever. This feature allows $VUL to become hyper-deflationary and a trusted store of value cryptocurrency over time.
