TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, today announced that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). As an EEA member, TRON DAO will collaborate with EEA and its members, the leading business adopters, innovators and leaders within the Ethereum ecosystem, to accelerate the pace of Ethereum business advancements and adoption.

TRON DAO is accelerating the progression of Web3 adoption across a global scale by creating novel and useful solutions for builders and consumers.

TRON blockchain Founder, H.E. Justin Sun said in a statement

> TRON and Ethereum have grown and matured together over the years, we want this affiliation to be a step forward for the industry to showcase that progress comes in many forms. Blockchain has the potential to change the world in manners we cannot fathom and we need to coordinate together to make it happen. I am optimistic that partnerships like this are one of the healthiest moves we can collectively do.

The EEA’s membership base represents companies from every region of the world. The EEA’s Interest Groups, Working Groups, and events bring together the top Ethereum and global business leaders, technologists, and industry experts to learn about the latest business reference implementations, real-world use cases, and technical innovations. 

The EEA’s educational primers, designed specifically for non-technical entrants to the Ethereum ecosystem, offer introductions to many of the different concepts and facets of Ethereum, and blockchain as a whole, to help more professionals get started on the platform.
