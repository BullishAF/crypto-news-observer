Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claims in a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1623459203150131201) that he's hearing rumors that the SEC wants to get rid of crypto staking for retail customers in the US. 

Many major cryptocurrencies are proof-of-stake(POS) blockchains such as Ethereum & Solana that aim to increase scalability and reduce carbon emissions which have been a major criticism of proof-of-work coins such as Bitcoin.

Most crypto exchanges run "validators" that allow customers to "stake" their coins with those validators and earn rewards that the exchanges receive from validating transactions.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong:
> Regulation by enforcement doesnâ€™t work. It encourages companies to operate offshore, which is what happened with FTX.
